_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

## 1. Definitions

**“Project”**: the official repository, binaries, and official servers of the game [Suroimd.io 2].  
**“Team”**: the official maintainers of the Project.  
**“Modder”** or **“Author”**: person or group who creates a mod, asset, map, skin, sound, or other independent contribution.  
**“Mod”**: any package that changes gameplay behavior, assets, UI, maps, game rules, or adds content.  
**“Assets”**: images, sounds, models, music, text, and other multimedia resources.  
**“Official client”**: version signed and published by the official Team and main Author.  
**“Official server”**: server operated, moderated, or validated by the official Team.  
**“Community server”**: server maintained by third parties (modders, players, or community members).

---

## 2. Scope of the License

The Team grants the public permission to:

- Use, copy, modify, and redistribute the Project’s source code and Mods licensed under BR-BPL;  
- Run and host community servers;  
- Create Mods and alternative clients, respecting the terms of this license.

All Mods must be **open-source** (code) and include a compatible license for assets (MIT is recommended for code, and CC-BY-SA for assets), unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Team.

---

## 3. Modder Rights

The Modder retains ownership of their original content (code, images, sounds, etc.).

When submitting a Mod to the official repository or “Featured Mods” system, the Modder grants the Team a **non-exclusive, irrevocable, sublicensable, and perpetual license** to use, modify, distribute, and integrate the Mod into official versions, marketing materials, and Project packages.

The Modder remains free to reuse their own content in other projects, provided it does not infringe on the [Suroimd.io 2] trademark or visual identity.

---

## 4. Attribution and Credits

Each Mod must include a **CREDITS.md** (or `credits.txt`) file listing:

- Author(s);  
- License of the Mod;  
- Third-party credits used;  
- Link to the repository or Mod page.

The Team will display credits for incorporated Mods in appropriate places (loading screens, listings, etc.).

---

## 5. Mod Monetization

Monetization of Mods (sales, microtransactions, paid access, direct advertising, etc.) **requires written agreement** with the Team.

Using the “[Suroimd.io 2]” name, logo, or branding in any monetized project also requires **prior written authorization**.

**Exception:** symbolic or experimental monetization in educational, research, or personal contexts is allowed  
(e.g., private server among friends, technical demo, explanatory videos).

The Team may offer **revenue-share contracts, special licenses, or official partnerships**.

---

## 6. Hacks, Tools, and Security

### 6.1 Development and Personal Use

Creating hacks, alternative clients, and experimental tools is **permitted** for study, teaching, learning, debugging, or private testing purposes, provided that:

- They are **not used on official servers**;  
- They **do not interfere with public matches**;  
- They are **clearly identified** as experimental and not authorized for competitive use.

### 6.2 Distribution and Sharing

It is **prohibited** to distribute, publish, or promote hacks intended for use in official servers, ranked matches, or competitive events.

If a developer publishes a tool or mod that *could* be used for cheating, they must include an explicit warning in the repository, documentation, or project name stating:

> “This modification is experimental and must not be used on official [Suroimd.io 2] servers.”

Sharing hacks intended for official server use constitutes a **serious license violation**, subject to legal action and permanent removal.

---

## 7. Community Servers and Rules

### 7.1 Administrator Freedom

Community server administrators have **full freedom** to define their own rules, game modes, and permissions  
(including experimental servers with mods or hacks allowed).

### 7.2 Minimum Mandatory Restrictions

All **public servers** (visible on the global list) must comply with these minimum conditions:

- Prohibition of illegal or criminal behavior (racism, harassment, doxxing, copyright infringement, child exploitation, etc.);  
- Clear disclosure of local rules and special permissions (e.g., “server with hacks enabled”);  
- Compliance with Team notices in cases of proven abuse.

**Private servers** (friends, study, restricted use) are exempt from these restrictions as long as they do not engage in illegal practices.

### 7.3 Official Servers

Official and ranked servers require the official client and prohibit:

- Hacks or scripts that alter competitive outcomes;  
- Unreported exploits;  
- Unsigned modifications.

---

## 8. Conduct and Integrity

When participating in official servers or using Project resources, players must follow these rules:

- **Smurfing:** prohibited in tournaments and events; tolerated in ranked play if not abusive.  
- **Account sharing:** allowed, but the account owner is responsible for any actions taken.  
- **Fake news / misinformation:** prohibited when intended to deceive or profit; memes and satire are allowed.  
- **Toxic behavior:** hate speech, racism, xenophobia, and harassment are prohibited in official public channels.  
- **Bugs, exploits, and glitches:** reporting is encouraged; deliberate abuse may result in sanctions.  
- **Crimes:** any criminal act under local law results in expulsion and potential legal reporting.

---

## 9. Enforcement and Sanctions

The Team may **warn, suspend, or ban accounts**, revoke server access, remove Mods, block monetization, or take legal action in cases of violation.

Sanctions will be **proportional to the severity and intent** of the violation. The Team will always seek dialogue before permanent actions.

---

## 10. Disclaimer

The Project, the Team, and contributors provide the code, content, and services **“as-is”**, without express or implied warranties.  
No party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses resulting from the use of the Project or Mods.

---

## 11. Termination

The right to use this license is **automatic and continuous** as long as its terms are followed.  
In cases of serious violation not corrected within 30 days after notification, the license may be revoked by the Team.

---

## 12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

Disputes should preferably be resolved through dialogue between the parties.  
If no agreement is reached, **Brazilian law** applies, with jurisdiction in the city where the Team is based or as defined in a contract.
